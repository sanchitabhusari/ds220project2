What is the gender breakdown of the dataset? Females: 65 Males: 905

Out of all the Nobel Peace Prize winners since 1901, there have been 65 females and 905 males. Our bar chart shows the distribution of males and females who have won Nobel Peace Prizes.

The dataset has a significant majority of males, 905, compared to females, 65. This skew towards males suggests that the dataset may be imbalanced in terms of gender representation. This brings up the possibility of potential bias. The substantial difference in counts raises questions about the representativeness of the dataset. Firstly, in the 1900s, there were more males than females in the science and humanities industries. Furthermore, there could have been a potential bias when selecting the Nobel Peace prize winner in the 1900s. This could partially explain why there are more male than female winners. Overall, the gender breakdown for prize winners indicates a significant imbalance with a substantial majority of males as winners.
